# Privacy Policy

Hyprnote is a local-first AI notetaker. Recordings and transcriptions never leave your device unless you explicitly export or share them. This document explains what personal data we collect, why we collect it, how we use it, and the choices you have.

## 1. WHAT THIS POLICY COVERS

This policy applies to hyprnote.com, the Hyprnote desktop application, and any related services (together, the “Services”). “Personal Data” means information that identifies or relates to an identifiable individual. This policy does not cover third-party sites you reach from our Services.

## 2. QUICK SUMMARY

• No meeting audio or transcripts are uploaded to Hyprnote servers.

• We do not train AI models on your Personal Data.

• We use a small set of service providers (listed below) for analytics, support, payments, feedback, visitor insights, and error logging.

• You can reach us any time at [privacy@hyprnote.com](mailto:privacy@hyprnote.com).

We do not record or store meeting audio, video, or transcribed text in the cloud. All processing happens locally on your machine.

• Understand product usage to improve features and stability.

• Respond to your questions or feedback.

## 6. COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES

The website uses first-party and third-party cookies for analytics (PostHog) and visitor identification (Snitcher, RB2B). You can disable cookies in your browser or use an ad-blocker; core site functionality will still work, though certain analytics and personalization features may not.

## 7. DATA STORAGE AND SECURITY

• Crash reports – deleted after 90 days.

• Raw analytics events – deleted or aggregated after 12 months.
