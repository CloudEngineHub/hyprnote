# What is Hyprnote?

Hyprnote is awesome because...

* it's open-source
* you can transcribe and summarize all locally
* but also you can bring your own models



## How does Hyprnote work?

Using Hyprnote is basically having a personal assistant just for your meetings but in a very private manner. Hyprnote will never betray you and hand over data to others.
